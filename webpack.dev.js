// ************** style-loader VS MiniCssExtractPlugin  *************

// style-loader takes the converted javscript from css loader and places it in the minfied javascript file. In this scenario while loading DOM there is no style tag encountered and style is applied after DOM has loaded and all the js files have loaded. So, there is a flicker on the screen. To avoid this MiniCssExtractPlugin is used.

// MiniCssExtractPlugin takes the converted javscript from CSS loader and creates a css file and then injects a style tag in the DOM pointing it to that CSS. This way while rendering the DOM styke tag is encountered and styles are applied simultaneously and flickering is not experienced.
